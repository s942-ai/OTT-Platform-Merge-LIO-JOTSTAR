## 🚀 Project Overview

This project focuses on analysing the potential merger between Lio, a leading Indian telecom provider, and Jotstar, one of India’s most prominent streaming platforms.
By combining LioCinema’s large subscriber base with Jotstar’s diverse content library, the goal is to transform India’s digital streaming experience.
The analysis covers January to November 2024 data from both platforms to evaluate performance, content consumption, subscriber behaviour, and subscription trends.
The insights generated will help management make data-driven decisions for post-merger strategies, aiming to position Lio–Jotstar as the leading OTT platform in India.

## 📌 Problem Statement

The Lio management team requires a comprehensive understanding of both platforms’ current performance before finalising the merger.
They need detailed insights into:

Content library strengths and gaps.

Subscriber growth and demographics.

Inactivity trends by segment.

Subscription upgrade/downgrade patterns.

Content consumption behaviour and preferences.

Without these insights, it will be challenging to create a unified post-merger strategy that optimises content offerings, increases engagement, and maximises revenue potential.
